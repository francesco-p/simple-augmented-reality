# Simple Augmented Reality System

![alt text](./data/cv.gif "Logo Title Text 1")

This is the fourth and last part of the projects that I had to develop for the Computer Vision course.

In order to run it you need OpenCV installed in your system, then:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make run
```

If you don't have OpenCV installed in the default location (for me is `/usr/local/lib/`), you can specify it through: `cmake ../ -DOpenCV_DIR="/path/to/opencv/build"`.
